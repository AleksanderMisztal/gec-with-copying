# Todos

## Important
- Be done as fast as possible
- Do graphs and visulisations
- Write the thing

## For writing
- Get a high score with the copying transformer
- Visualise copying
- Visualise attention
- Qualitative visualisations
- Architecture diagrams

## Experiments / extensions
- How to combine the scores? Experiment with different methods

## Optimizing the model
- Make beam search work
- Masking in copying
- Lr scheduler decreasing slowly (~1/sqrt x instead of 2^-x) on epochs with no progress
- Grid search hyperparameters
- Add pad masks to custom
- Label smoothing as regularization?
