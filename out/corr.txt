He would also have said that since there were no testing facilities present , the engineers could have brought the wheel out to other countries to run the required tests .
Funds from the government are also needed to aid voluntary welfare organizations .
As the economy develops , the country will generate more money and thus be able to spend a greater amount of money on programs such as health care support for the elderly .
There is no doubt that nuclear power can efficiently help ease climate change with low cost .
To sum up , two main problems hamper engineering design processes , namely low technological standards and intellectual property rights .
In this essay , we will discuss how current research and development has helped to ease some of the issues raised by immobility , health conditions and resource management that the aged face .
( Chapin et al,2004 ) .
There has been a concern over how the growth of nuclear power will contribute to nuclear proliferation .
Such various government polices provides the aged with economic solutions , social solutions , healthcare solutions to the problems that they may face hence easing the growing problems faced by an aging population .

This is because red wine contains a substance known as " resveratrol " .
Singapore uses only one-fourth of its taxes , which is about only $ 381 per capita on health and individuals pay for the rest
We use electricity , watch television , surf surf billions of websites billions of websites every day .
Compared with that , the number of coal mine accidents deaths is much llarger reaching 7530 per year .
With current nuclear energy wastes sitting in the storage sites , GE Hitachi Company believes the power extracted would be able to meet 70 years of energy demands in USA .
with a healthy mindset , they are more likely to win the battle against their illnesses .
Innovations and technologies are for the public use , and they are not completed without confirmations from lab work and data. .
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is the large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .
they may know about the person 's potential disabling disease .
As far as accidents are concerned , coal mining is more dangerous , as 100 miners die in mining per year in the U.S and another 100 die in transporting .
And because we know very clearly that it is dangerous , we devote very much effort to monitor the whole process in case accidents happen .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Signboards that are in the area of traffic congestion and other possible affected areas would be updated and give suggestions to the drivers to redirect them away from the traffic congestion .
Therefore , the application of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is hindered .
