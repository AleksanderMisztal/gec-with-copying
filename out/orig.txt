He could also have said that since there are no testing facilities present , the engineers could have brought the wheel out to other country to run the required tests .
Funds from the government are also needed to aid the voluntary welfare organizations .
As the economic develops , the country will generate more money and thus be able to spend a greater amount of money on programs such as health care support for elderly .
There is no doubt that nuclear power can efficiently go against climate change with low cost .
To sum up , there are two main problems that widely recognized as the factors that hamper engineering design process , namely low technological standards and not highly valued proprietary intellectual property .
In this essay , we will discuss how current research and development helped to ease some of the issues raised by immobility , health conditions and resource management that the aged faces .
( Chapin et al,2004 )
There has been a concern over the growth of nuclear power will contribute to nuclear proliferation .
Such various government polices provides the aged with economic solutions , social solutions , healthcare solutions to the problems that they may face and hence easing the growing problems faced by an aging population .

We use electricity , watch television , surfing around the billions of website every day .
Compared with that , the number of coal mine accidents deaths is much largerit reaches 7530 per year .
With current nuclear energy wastes sitting in the storage sites , GE Hitachi Company believe the power extracted would be able to meet 70 years energy demands in USA .
Hence , with a healthy mindset set in their minds , they are more likely to win the battle against their illnesses .
Innovations and technologies are for the public use , and without the confirmation from lab work and data , they are not completed .
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is due to large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .
They may know the person 's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally .
If talking about the accidents , coal mining is more dangerous , 100 miners are dead per year in the U.S and other 100 die in transporting it .

Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Signboards that are in area of traffic congestion and other possible affected areas would be updated and give suggestion to the drivers to redirect them away from the traffic congestion .
